I am an undergrad at Dartmouth College majoring in Electrical Engineering as part of the dual degree program. I was previously at Amherst College where I double majored in CS and History. 

I am broadly interested in computer systems and architecture. My more recent focus has been in graph processing and analytics. I am also interested in the history of late imperial China.
