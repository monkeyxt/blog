I am an undergrad at Dartmouth College majoring in Electrical Engineering as part of the [Dual-Degree Program](https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/undergraduate/dual). I am broadly interested in quantum information science. My more recent focus has been in the intersection between quantum computing and high-performance computing.

I was previously at Amherst College where I double majored in CS and History. At Amherst, I worked on graph processing and analytics. On the history side, I concentrated in the history of late imperial China.
