I am an undergrad at [Dartmouth College](https://home.dartmouth.edu/) majoring in Electrical Engineering as part of the [Dual-Degree Program](https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/undergraduate/dual). I am broadly interested in quantum information science. My more recent focus has been in the intersection between quantum computing and high-performance computing.

Previously I was at [Amherst College](https://www.amherst.edu/) where I double majored in CS and History. At Amherst, I worked on graph processing and analytics. On the history side, I concentrated on late imperial China.

I also spent time working at Hudson River Trading and Amazon Web Services.
